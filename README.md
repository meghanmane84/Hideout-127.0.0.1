### RainMap India

Overview:
RainMap India provides real-time visualization of rainfall conditions across India. Utilizing AI techniques, it generates interactive maps illustrating current precipitation patterns.

Important Notes:
-This project may require a dedicated GPU for optimal performance, especially during GAN model training.
-The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for CSV file generation may take longer on Windows systems due to CPU constraints.

Project Potential:
Despite challenges, RainMap India demonstrates a promising model architecture. Note that dummy tensors were used in the absence of a GPU, showcasing the project's potential success with ample computational resources.
